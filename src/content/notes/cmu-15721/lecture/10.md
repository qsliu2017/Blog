## _Lecture Note_ 10. Multi-Way Join Algorithms

Binary join's performance decreases as the join's output is larger than its inputs. Worst-case optimal joins (WCOJ) perform join by examining an attribute at a time instead of a relation at a time. The worst-case runtime of the algorithm meets a known lower bound for the worst-case runtime of any join algorithm.

WCOJ has the best runtime of all join algorithm when the query and data represent the worst possible scenario. These joins will be more common because the SQL 2023 standard includes property graph query extensions (see [Peter Eisentraut's overview](https://peter.eisentraut.org/blog/2023/04/04/sql-2023-is-finished-here-is-whats-new#:~:text=semantics%20are%20defined.-,Property%20Graph%20Queries,-A%20whole%20new)). For example, finding a path in a graph involves a huge number of self joins.

[Adopting Worst-Case Optimal Joins in Relational Database Systems](https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2024/papers/10-multiwayjoins/p1891-freitag.pdf) (M. Freitag, et al., VLDB 2020) summarizes WCOJ algorithms and provides its optimized implementation. No TL;DR here.
