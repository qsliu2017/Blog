## The Programming Language

When I was an entry-level programmer, I thought _programming_ is the _programming languages_.
I started programming with C. So when I considered how to program, I actually got the variables, `if`-`else`, `while`/`for` coming up in my mind.
Then I got to learn more programming languages for finishing my homework or just for fun. For each programming language, I learned the different grammar and best practice.

I found that most entry-level programmers have the same idea. They call themselves 'C++ Programmer' or 'Java Programmer'.

## The Programming Paradigm

I started to know object oriented, and read that classic _Designing Pattern_ (that's one of my favorite).

## Programmable Environment

I'd like to try everything in this field, and I've writing the web page, the enterprice application, the cloud, the kernel.

During the journey, I find that we actually locate at some specific programmable environments.
When I create a web frontend page, I manipulate the DOM. For cloud native application, I ?? the kubernetes resources. As a system programmer, I interact with the data structure within the kernel by syscall APIs. And for kernel programming, I care about the CPU and the RAM.

Among these environment, most of them are vitrual, like that in the web brower. Some of them are relative to physical environments, like kernel and network. Despite electronic devices, there are quamtum devices (one of my best friend works on it).

## Affinity

I call the programmable environment as the problems model, the programming paradigm as the thinking way of we the human, and PL as the tool to express our solution.

Some PLs have affinity with some paradigm, like C++ to object oriented. Some PLs have similar elements as the environment, like C to CPU ISA.
